		<p>Hello <%=current_user.name%>, and welcome to ROLLIN' in CA$H, the game where you get a chance 
		at early retirement. Before we get started there are a few basics you should get a handle on.</p>
		
		<p>The goal in this game is to retire from the working world by supplimenting your job income with your
		rental property income. Money from things such as investments or (in this case) rental properties, is
		refered to as "passive income" - income where you're no longer trading your time for a dollar bill.</p>
		
		<p>Real estate will become available to the market over time, however no more than 10 houses will be 
		available for purchase at a time. Each house will list it's cost to purchase (or value if you own it),
		it's style (such as "3Br/2Ba"), and it's "cashflow". Cashflow here, refers to the net profits (or loses)
		each month above all the expenses of owning the home once tenants pay rent. The more homes you own, the
		greater your net worth and the more passive income you'll obtain!</p>
		
		<p>Stocks play an important role in this game as well. You will have four (4) stocks to choose from and may 
		purchase as many as you can afford. The stock market will fluctuate over time and prices will either 
		increase or decrease. Although there is an inherent risk involved, there is the opportunity to greatly 
		increase your cash on hand - allowing you to purchase more homes quicker!</p>
		
		<p>The type of job you picked affected not only your hourly pay rate, but also the number of hours you work, 
		and your monthyl expenses. Your overall cashflow is how much money you have coming in after all your bills
		are paid up. This includes income from your rental properties and your job income (calculated on a monthly
		basis).</p>
